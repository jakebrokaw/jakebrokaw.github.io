    <!-- <p><strong>Problems:</strong> Our HR team requested that we redesign our careers page in a way that was fun and represented Formstack's culture and personality. They wanted to keep it simple and provide a way for the user to quickly jump to the open positions without having to scroll all the way to the bottom of the page.</p>
    <p><strong>Solutions:</strong> I led the redesign and development of this page. I created a sticky sub-navigation so that the user could quickly jump to a specific section. I created the icons and added animation once they were visible in an effort to add a little fun to the page. I think this design reflects Formstack's personality to potential hires.</p> -->

    <!-- <p><strong>Problems:</strong> We needed a new way to visually represent all of our integrations. We also wanted a way for users to easily search for integrations without having to scroll through the entire directory.</p>
    <p><strong>Solutions:</strong> I paired a clean "card" design with a subtle animation hover-effect to add some intrigue. I also created an easy-to-use search bar at the top of the page to help ensure users can quickly find what they’re looking for.</p> -->

    <!-- <p><strong>Problems:</strong> We needed a way to easily show all of our form templates. We also needed to give the user a preview of the template without slowing the page down while the browser loads all of the thumbnails.</p>
    <p><strong>Solutions:</strong> I used a lazy load method to load only the images that were in view; as the user scrolls the thumbnails are then loaded. To test a template, the user just has to click on the thumbnail and a preview window opens up with a functioning template.</p> -->

    <!-- <p><strong>Problems:</strong> This page didn't have a section for Add-Ons or HIPAA/Enterprise, so I was asked to design those sections. I was also asked to redesign the FAQ section of this page in a way that consolidated most of the text unless the user wanted to see a specific answer.</p>
    <p><strong>Solutions:</strong> I started by adding a stick sub-navigation to help the user know where they were on the page. I designed the Add-Ons section to reflect a similar section in our app. I wanted to make sure we didn't overload the user with text, so I created toggle boxes to show and hide content based on what was selected. Similarly, I then implemented an accordion-style list for the FAQ section.</p> -->

    <p><strong>Solutions:</strong> I took the assets and branding information they had and designed this poster. I wanted it to be attention grabbing, in hopes to bring more people to the gala, but simple and content-focused.</p> -->
