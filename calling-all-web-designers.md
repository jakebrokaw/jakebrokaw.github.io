title: Calling all web designers, eh?
---

<p class="blog-disclaimer margin-top-30 margin-bottom-30"><em>I recently read on <a href="http://sophieshepherd.com/2017/12/06/hiring-a-web-designer.html">Sophie's blog</a> that the design team at GitHub is looking for more web designers. This is sort of my "response" to that post and mirrors it almost paragraph for paragraph.</em> ðŸ˜Ž</p>

I am a web designer for [Formstack](https://formstack.com) and have been working there for three years. I also do some freelance design work as well as co-run a [small design studio](https://www.etsy.com/shop/ChaibuStudio){:target="_blank"} with my wife. I believe my skills, experience, and work ethic make me a great fit for the GitHub design team.

## What kinds of projects have I been working on?

- Designing and building new marketing pages for Formstack to support new features and initiatives, and then using data to iterate on those designs.
- Defining direction and designing content-rich areas of Formstack, like our [Webinar pages](/portfolio/formstack-webinars).
- Designing and building pages to support marketing initiatives, such as [Formstack's Ultimate Guide to Online Form Design](/portfolio/ultimate-form-design).
- Working with our product and marketing teams on how to best deliver the great content theyâ€™re creating, for example the new [Workflows add-on](/portfolio/workflows-add-on).
- Designing annual reports to help share data about Formstack with the world, for example, [The State of Lead Capture](/portfolio/lead-capture-report).
- Help design and build out conference websites, for example, [Informed Indy](/portfolio/informed-indy).
- Creating and contributing to a [design system](/portfolio/design-system). I helped design, create, and implement our brand design system. I contribute to it almost daily in various forms. From designing and building new components, to refactoring old Scss and PHP, to documentation. I was recently asked to [give a talk about our design system](https://www.instagram.com/p/BaG8lvUlkcj/?taken-by=jacobrokaw){:target="_blank"} to the [Tulsa UX](https://tulsaux.com/){:target="_blank"} group.
- I also use this site as a playground to try out new designs, tools, and libraries. It's built using GitHub Pages and Jekyll.

## Who have I been working with?

I've been working with very talented designers, developers, marketers, copywriters, data specialists, and product managers. I work remotely but meet up with everyone IRL a few times a year to hang out. While I have been working with amazing people, this new challenge and a chance to grow even more excites me.

I love working in web design, but it's always the people you work with that can make or break a job. It sure sounds like the team at GitHub is comprised of incredible people who I'd be honored to learn from. That's a huge reason why I'd love to work at GitHub.

## What skills do I have?

While my background has been in both web development and design, I think of myself as first and foremost a designer. I think good design should almost go unnoticed, allowing the content to be the MVP. If users can't understand or are unable to see the value a web page is supposed to convey, then the design, no matter how beautiful or trendy it is, has failed the user. I also believe accessibility is an underrated aspect of design, but it's crucial if you want to treat all your users as equals. That being said, there's a lot of value in keeping up with current design trends that can help the content come alive with a certain graphic or illustration, as long as it is guided by the right intentions and stays true to the brand.

My current team is pretty small, so I'm used to building most, if not all, of my designs in the browser. I'm no expert, but I have 5+ years experience writing HTML, CSS (and Sass), as well as JS. I find that there's a lot of room for creativity when writing clean and efficient DRY code.

I've been using GitHub, in some capacity, almost daily the past three years. I really enjoy how it's simplified our workflow and I can honestly say it's one of my favorite tools.

Writing is a skill I know I can improve upon. I thoroughly enjoy it, I just don't give myself enough time to focus on writing publicly. However, in a work settingâ€”especially a remote work settingâ€”excellent written communication is essential. I try to explain things as clearly as possible when writing out questions, documentation, or even a simple email, as I know how frustrating it can be to decipher confusing messages.

I've been working remotely for the past three years and while it did take some getting used to at first, I have found that I'm far more productive in a remote environment. I love the ability to be "heads down" focused on something, but also having the option to reach out to someone if I have a question or need feedback.

## This sounds pretty great, but we're still not sure if you're a good fit?

I definitely understand that. I tried to make myself sound amazing in hopes of landing an interview, but the truth is I'm pretty overwhelmed most days thinking of all the things I need to learn or get better at. If you and your team are even slightly interested, I'd absolutely love to discuss this opportunity more. I appreciate your time and consideration!
