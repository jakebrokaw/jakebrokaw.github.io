title: A Short Story On How Help Scout & Jake Saved The World
---

## Chapter I: The Beginning

The world was becoming a very dark and strange place: people were eating Tide Pods; companies were struggling to provide personalized and genuine interactions to their customers; someone was trying to talk people into paying $400 for an internet-connected juicer. Luckily, the universe had a plan to bring positive change and stability back into the world -- a plan that involved pairing a mild-mannered front-end developer with an organization focused on <a href="https://www.helpscout.net/about/" target="_blank" md_>helping others build a company they love</a>.

Before we dive into the epic tale of how these characters combined their powers to save the world, letâ€™s learn a little more about our mild-mannered front-end developer, Jake, and see why the universe felt he was the right person to join forces with Help Scout.

## Chapter II: The Backstory

Jake Brokaw has spent the last three years working remotely as a Web Developer and Designer in the Marketing department for <a href="https://formstack.com" target="_blank" md_>Formstack</a>, a SaaS company. Prior to that he spent two years as an IT Applications Developer for <a href="https://www.nationwide.com/" target="_blank" md_>Nationwide Insurance</a>. He loves the remote life and has lived in four different cities in the past five years. He and his wife (and their wacky cats) just <a href="/moving-to-the-northwest" target="_blank" md_>moved up to Portland, Oregon</a>. He thought his life was chaotic enough for the time being, but then...

_**PLOT TWIST!**_ ðŸ’¨

One day, while surfing the interwebs, the universe planted a seedling of an idea into Jake's mind. The idea was as simple as it was profound: He could combine his skillset with his passion for helping others so that companies and their customers might benefit from excellent, personalized experiences.

After this realization, the only question left to answer was: Who could Jake pair up with to accomplish this quest? Fortunately, the universe directed Jake to Help Scout's homepage. From that moment on, Jake's whole world was...different. Life started to make sense again. The air was fresher, food tasted better, the sky was filled with angels singing "Don't Stop Me Now," <a href="https://www.good.is/articles/happiest-song-on-earth#HgzGwKwLmgM" target="_blank" md_>the happiest song on Earth</a> (listening to this song while finishing the rest of the story is encouraged ðŸ˜‰).

## Chapter III: The Match

Once the universe made it blatantly clear that Jake and Help Scout should join forces, they both decided they couldn't delay the inevitable any longer.

Jake had used his love of writing scalable and semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to <a href="/work" target="_blank" md_>build intentional and informative landing pages</a> in the past, but now he was able to do it knowing those skills resulted in SMBs seeing how simple personalized customer experiences could be. Jake's knowledge and experience with building and maintaining <a href="https://formstack.com/brand/" target="_blank" md_>Formstack's Brand Manual and Design System</a> would also come in handy when working with and contributing to Help Scout's <a href="http://style.helpscout.com/" target="_blank" md_>impressive Style Guide</a>. (Fun fact: he was even invited to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BaG8lvUlkcj/?taken-by=jacobrokaw" target="_blank" md_>speak to the Tulsa UX group</a> about his experience with design systems.) Lastly, since Jake is also a designer and has worked with both marketing and UX designers, he understands the importance of a collaborative design and development process.

## Chapter IV: The World is Saved

Because of the work that Help Scout and Jake were able to accomplish together, the world was a safer and brighter place to live. People went back to using Tide Pods solely for laundry purposes. Businesses of all sizes realized how easy it was to provide their customers with excellent customer service. The juicer startup, Juicero, was thankfully shut down. All was well with the world.

The universe knew what it was doing when it paired Jake with Help Scout, which was already contributing so much good to the world. They, along with everyone else in the world, lived happily ever after.
