title: A Short Story On How Mozilla & Jake Saved The World
---

## Chapter I: The Beginning

The world was becoming a very dark and strange place: people were eating Tide Pods; the Internet as we know it was under attack and large corporations were collecting personal information on users without their knowledge; someone was trying to talk people into paying $400 for a "high-tech" juicer. Luckily, the universe had a plan to bring positive change and stability back into the worldâ€”a plan that involved pairing a mild-mannered front-end developer with an organization focused on <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/" target="_blank" md_>ensuring the Internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all</a>.

Before we dive into the epic tale of how these characters combined their powers to save the world, letâ€™s learn a little more about our mild-mannered front-end developer, Jake, and see why the universe felt he was the right person to join forces with Mozilla.

## Chapter II: The Backstory

Jake Brokaw has spent the last three years working remotely as a Web Developer and Designer in the Marketing department for <a href="https://formstack.com" target="_blank" md_>Formstack</a>, a SaaS company. Prior to that he spent two years as an IT Applications Developer for <a href="https://www.nationwide.com/" target="_blank" md_>Nationwide Insurance</a>. He loves the remote life and has lived in four different cities in the past five years. He and his wife (and their wacky cats) just <a href="/moving-to-the-northwest" target="_blank" md_>moved up to Portland, Oregon</a>. He thought his life was chaotic enough for the time being, but then...

_**PLOT TWIST!**_ ðŸ’¨

One day, while surfing the interwebs, the universe planted an idea into Jake's mind. The idea was as simple as it was profound: He could combine his skillset with his passion for helping others in a way that might make the Internet a better place for all.

After this realization, the only question left to answer was: Who might Jake pair up with to accomplish this quest? Fortunately, the perfect role opened up with one of Jake's favorite organizationsâ€”**Mozilla** (he was already a Firefox evangelist and proudly displays it's logo on his laptop in sticker form). From that moment on, Jake's whole world was...different. Life started to make sense again. The air was fresher, food tasted better, the sky was filled with angels singing "Don't Stop Me Now," <a href="https://www.good.is/articles/happiest-song-on-earth#HgzGwKwLmgM" target="_blank" md_>the happiest song on Earth</a> (listening to this song while finishing the rest of the story is encouraged ðŸ˜‰).

## Chapter III: The Match

Once the universe made it blatantly clear that Jake and Mozilla should join forces, they both decided they couldn't delay the inevitable any longer.

Jake had used his love of writing scalable and semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to <a href="/work" target="_blank" md_>build intentional and informative landing pages</a> in the past, but now he was able to do it knowing those skills would help promote a more open and accessible Internet for everyone around the globe. Jake's knowledge and experience with creating and maintaining <a href="https://formstack.com/brand/" target="_blank" md_>Formstack's Brand Manual and Design System</a> would also come in handy when working with and contributing to Mozilla's <a href="https://mozilla.design/" target="_blank" md_>impressive Style Guide</a>. (Fun fact: Jake was even invited to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BaG8lvUlkcj/?taken-by=jacobrokaw" target="_blank" md_>speak to the Tulsa UX group</a> about his experience with design systems.) Lastly, since he also has a design background and has worked with both marketing and UX designers, he understands how a collaborative design and development process can benefit users.

## Chapter IV: The World is Saved

Because of the work that Mozilla and Jake were able to accomplish together, the world was a safer and brighter place to live. Tide Pods were only used for laundry purposes again. The Internet continued to be a global public resource and was open and accessible to all. The juicer startup, Juicero, was thankfully shut down. All was well with the world.

The universe knew what it was doing when it paired Jake with Mozilla, which was already contributing so much good to the world. They, along with everyone else in the world, lived happily ever after.
