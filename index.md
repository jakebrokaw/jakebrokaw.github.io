<h1>Hey, I'm Jake.</h1>
I'm a web designer and front-end developer at [Formstack](https://www.formstack.com/about). Originally from Ohio, I now enjoy being a nomad of sorts --- moving from city to city, meeting new people, and having new experiences. Currently, I live in Tulsa, OK with my talented wife, [Sarah](sparks-of-art.com), and our [hyperactive cats](https://www.instagram.com/p/wm-FsonqsK/?taken-by=jacobrokaw). Besides designing and coding websites, I like to spend my time reading, illustrating, exploring, and drinking a good cup of coffee/tea.
