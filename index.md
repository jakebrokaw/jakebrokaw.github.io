### Hey, I'm Jake.
I'm a web designer and front-end developer at [Formstack](https://www.formstack.com/about). Originally from Ohio, I now enjoy being a nomad of sorts --- moving from city to city, meeting new people, and having new experiences. Currently, I live in Tulsa, OK with my talented wife, [Sarah](sparks-of-art.com), and our [hyperactive cats](https://www.instagram.com/p/wm-FsonqsK/?taken-by=jacobrokaw). Besides designing and coding websites, I like to spend my time reading, illustrating, exploring, and drinking a good cup of coffee/tea.

### Currently reading:

<em>[Why Does the World Exist?](https://www.amazon.com/Why-Does-World-Exist-Existential/dp/0871403595/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=)</em> --- Jim Holt
<br>
<em>[JavaScript for Web Designers](https://abookapart.com/products/javascript-for-web-designers)</em> --- Mat Marquis

### Work with me:

If you're in need of a front-end developer/designer or if you'd just like an illustrated portrait of your pets, please don't hesitate to reach out!
