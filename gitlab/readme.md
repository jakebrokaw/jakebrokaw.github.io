# GitLab Web Developer/Designer Project

Thanks for considering my project! Here's a super quick summary of what I used to build this landing page which has  client side validation on the sign-up form.

## Technology Used:

- Foundation 6.4.3
- jQuery 2.2.4
- jQuery Validate (for client side validation)
- Google Fonts: Source Sans Pro
- Good ole HTML
- Good ole CSS
  - Normally I prefer working with Sass and would break out the styles into partial files, but I figured it'd be easiest to have one main CSS file for review.
