title: A Story On How Doist & Jake Saved The World
---

## Chapter I: The Beginning

The world was becoming a very dark and strange place: kids were eating Tide Pods; individuals and teams were too distracted to be productive; someone was selling a "high-tech" juicer for $400; etc. Luckily, the universe had a plan to bring positive change and stability back into the worldâ€”a plan that involved pairing a mild-mannered web developer with an organization focused on <a href="https://doist.com/about" target="_blank" md_>empowering people to live fulfilling lives</a>.

Before we dive in to the epic tale of how these characters combined their powers to save the world, letâ€™s learn a little more about our mild-mannered web developer, Jake, and see why the universe felt he was the right person to join forces with Doist.

## Chapter II: The Backstory

Jake Brokaw has spent the last four years working remotely as a Web Developer & Designer for <a href="https://formstack.com" target="_blank" md_>Formstack</a>. He and his team oversee and develop websites and branding materials for two recently acquired SaaS companies as well. He has also spent time as an IT Applications Developer for <a href="https://www.nationwide.com/" target="_blank" md_>Nationwide Insurance</a>, working as a freelance web designer, and even running a small Etsy shop with his wife. He has taken advantage of the remote life, living in four different cities in the past five years. He and his wife (and their crazy cats) recently <a href="/moving-to-the-northwest" target="_blank" md_>moved up to Portland, Oregon</a>. He thought his life was chaotic enough for the time being, but then...

_**PLOT TWIST!**_ ðŸ’¨

One day, while surfing the interwebs, the universe planted an idea into Jake's mind. The idea was as simple as it was profound: He should combine his skillset with his passions for organization and productivity.

After this realization, the only question left to answer was: Who might Jake pair up with to accomplish this quest? Fortunately, the perfect role opened up with a company helping others stay productiveâ€”**Doist**. From that moment on, Jake's whole world was...different. Life started to make sense again. The air was fresher, food tasted better, the sky was filled with birds singing "Don't Stop Me Now," <a href="https://www.good.is/articles/happiest-song-on-earth" target="_blank" md_>the happiest song on Earth</a> (listening to this song while finishing the rest of the story is encouraged ðŸ˜‰).

## Chapter III: The Match

Once the universe made it blatantly clear that Jake and Doist should join forces, they both decided they couldn't delay the inevitable any longer.

Jake had used his love of writing scalable and semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to <a href="/work" target="_blank" md_>create intentional and informative sites and landing pages</a> in the past, but now he was able to do it knowing those skills would help people stay focused on what mattered most. Jake's knowledge and experience with creating, implementing, and maintaining <a href="https://formstack.com/brand/" target="_blank" md_>Formstack's Brand Design System</a> allowed him to create thoughtful and well crafted components for Doist's products. (Fun fact: Jake was even invited to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BaG8lvUlkcj/?taken-by=jacobrokaw" target="_blank" md_>speak to the Tulsa UX group</a> about his experience with design systems.) Lastly, since he is a designer as well, he understands how a collaborative design and development process can benefit a company and it's users.

## Chapter IV: The World is Saved

Because of the work that Doist and Jake were able to accomplish together, the world was a safer and brighter place to live. Tide Pods went back to being used solely for laundry purposes. Individuals and teams had peace-of-mind, knowing that all their tasks were accounted for. The $400 juicer startup, Juicero, was thankfully shut down. All was well with the world.

The universe knew what it was doing when it paired Jake with Doist, a company that was already contributing so much good to the world. They, along with everyone else in the world, lived happily ever after.
