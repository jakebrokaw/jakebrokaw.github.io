title: A Short Story on how GitHub & Jake Saved the World
---

## Chapter I: The Beginning

The world was becoming a very dark and strange place: kids were eating Tide Pods; banking was unnecessarily complicated; someone was selling a "high-tech" juicer for $400. Luckily, the universe had a plan to bring positive change and stability back into the worldâ€”a plan that involved pairing a mild-mannered web designer with an organization focused on <a href="https://www.github.com/about" target="_blank" md_>helping people learn, share, and work together to build software</a>.

Before we dive in to the epic tale of how these characters combined their powers to save the world, letâ€™s learn a little more about our mild-mannered web designer, Jake, and see why the universe felt he was the right person to join forces with GitHub.

## Chapter II: The Backstory

Jake Brokaw has spent the last three years working remotely as a Web Designer and Developer in the Marketing department for a SaaS company called <a href="https://formstack.com" target="_blank" md_>Formstack</a>. Prior to that he spent two years as an IT Applications Developer for <a href="https://www.nationwide.com/" target="_blank" md_>Nationwide Insurance</a>. He has taken advantage of the remote life living in four different cities in the past five years. He and his wife (and their crazy cats) recently <a href="/moving-to-the-northwest" target="_blank" md_>moved up to Portland, Oregon</a>. He thought his life was chaotic enough for the time being, but then...

_**PLOT TWIST!**_ ðŸ’¨

One day, while surfing the interwebs, the universe planted an idea into Jake's mind. The idea was as simple as it was profound: He should combine his skillset with his passion for helping others.

After this realization, the only question left to answer was: Who might Jake pair up with to accomplish this quest? Fortunately, the perfect role opened up with one of his favorite companies, **GitHub**. From that moment on, Jake's whole world was...different. Life started to make sense again. The air was fresher, food tasted better, the sky was filled with angels singing "Don't Stop Me Now," <a href="https://www.good.is/articles/happiest-song-on-earth#HgzGwKwLmgM" target="_blank" md_>the happiest song on Earth</a> (listening to this song while finishing the rest of the story is encouraged ðŸ˜‰).

## Chapter III: The Match

Once the universe made it blatantly clear that Jake and GitHub should join forces, they both decided they couldn't delay the inevitable any longer.

Jake had used his love of writing scalable and semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to <a href="/work" target="_blank" md_>build intentional and informative landing pages</a> in the past, but now he was able to do it knowing those skills would help provide people with confidence in their money and their bank. Jake's knowledge and experience with creating, implementing, and maintaining <a href="https://formstack.com/brand/" target="_blank" md_>Formstack's Brand Design System</a> allowed him to design and build thoughtful, well-crafted components across GitHubâ€™s site. (Fun fact: Jake was even invited to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BaG8lvUlkcj/?taken-by=jacobrokaw" target="_blank" md_>speak to the Tulsa UX group</a> about his experience with design systems.) Lastly, because he has worked with all types of designers and developers, he understands how a collaborative design and development process can benefit users.

## Chapter IV: The World is Saved

Because of the work that GitHub and Jake were able to accomplish together, the world was a safer and brighter place to live. Tide Pods went back to being used solely for laundry purposes. People from all over the world finally felt confident with their financial situation because they were banking with GitHub. The $400 juicer startup, Juicero, was thankfully shut down. All was well with the world.

The universe knew what it was doing when it paired Jake with GitHub, which was already contributing so much good to the world. They, along with everyone else in the world, lived happily ever after.
