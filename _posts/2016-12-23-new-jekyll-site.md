title: Creating my new website with GitHub Pages and Jekyll
---

I'll be writing a quick tutorial on how I set up my new website + blog using GitHub Pages and Jekyll. I followed a lot of great resources, that are easily accessible on the interwebs, but I think it'd be nice to have my entire process documented in case someone else goes about it the same way I did.

Until then, please excuse any bugs or typos you may see. I did this all in about a day, and didn't spend a ton of time combing every aspect of the site just yet. Thanks for stopping by though!

If you're here and somehow dying to make a blog/website using GitHub Pages + Jekyll immediately, [this article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) is a great place to start. You can obviously Google your way to figuring out the rest. Otherwise, stop by again soon. I'll most likely have the post completed in a couple days anyway.

If you'd like to get in contact, feel free to shoot me an [email](mailto:jacobrokaw@gmail.com).
