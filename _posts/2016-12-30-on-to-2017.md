At the beginning on 2016, I wrote down some personal goals I wanted to accomplish by the end of the year. Now that the year is wrapping up and another one approaches, I thought I'd follow up on my goals from 2016 and jot down my new goals for 2017.

<h2 class="blog-subhead">2016 Goals (and updates):</h2>

**1. Start meditating frequently**

✔ — This goal obviously wasn't very specific. I'm marking it complete as I did meditate more frequently compared to last year. But, as you'll read in a bit, I'll make this more specific for next year.

**2. Make running a routine again**

𝙭 — Nope. Not even close.

**3. Start investing**

✔ — I've already been contributing to my 401k ever since I got my first job out of college, but I had been wanting to do more investing for my future. Sarah and I did just that by opening and contributing monthly to an account with Betterment.

**4. Finish reading 12 books**

𝙭 and ✔ — I'm giving myself the "𝙭" because I did not finish 12 books; I only finished 7 this year. However, I'm giving myself the "✔" because this goal was super ambitious for me, and I'm still proud of myself for completing 7 books.

**5. Get commissioned illustration work**

✔ — I actually just completed my first commissioned illustration work a week or so ago. Excited for more to come in 2017 as you'll see below.

**6. Cut out toxic chemicals (deodorant, shampoo, etc...)**

✔ — Sarah and I have switched to chemical-free deodorant and toothpaste, and we now use a safer, organic shampoo. We still have a long way to go to _completely_ remove all harmful chemicals, but we made good progress this year.

**7. Delete my Facebook account**

𝙭 — Not sure if I still want to do this or not. I did, however, remove the Facebook app from my phone so that I wouldn't look at it as often.

**8. Blog / write more**

✔ — In 2015, I wrote one blog post. This is my second blog post of 2016, so ipso facto - check.

**9. Listen to podcasts more often**

✔ — Again, this goal was too broad. I did listen to podcasts more often this year even though that's hard to measure.

<h2 class="blog-subhead">Other notes on 2016:</h2>

This wasn't a goal at the beginning of 2016, but Sarah and I decided to stop eating meat and dairy, as well as all animal products back in February. I never thought I would have ever wanted to go vegan, but it's been one of the best decisions of my life. I'll write up another post soon with what I've learned since going vegan. We also moved to Tulsa earlier this year and we absolutely love it here. I don't think it's our last stop, but we've really enjoyed being in Tulsa.

Anyway, on to 2017...

<h2 class="blog-subhead">2017 Goals:</h2>

**1. Set up an Etsy shop for my pet illustrations**

<span class="sub-bullet"> — And sell at least 10 commissioned portraits</span>

**2. Daily meditation for at least 5 minutes**

**3. Read 8 books**

**4. 30 minute prep on Sunday afternoon/evenings to prepare for the week ahead**

**5. Exercise**

<span class="sub-bullet"> — Complete **Insanity** 4 times</span>

<span class="sub-bullet"> — Run or some other light workout in-between Insanity sessions</span>

<span class="sub-bullet"> — Start doing yoga with Sarah a couple days a week</span>

<br>
I decided to give myself fewer goals this year, because I think that'll help me stay focused and accomplish them all. They are also more specific so that I can measure whether or not I actually complete them. Here's to another year!
