excerpt_separator: <!--more-->

I've been getting into the habit of reflecting on the previous year and seeing which goals I was able to accomplish. I also like adding the current years goals as a way to hold myself accountable.<!--more-->

<h2 class="blog-subhead">2017 Goals (and updates):</h2>

<h3>✅ 1. Set up an Etsy shop for my pet illustrations</h3>

<span class="sub-bullet"> — And sell at least 10 commissioned portraits</span>

<span class="sub-bullet">☞ **Note:** Sarah and I set up our <a href="https://etsy.com/shop/ChaibuStudio">Etsy shop</a> this year, and I more than doubled this goal by selling 21 pet portraits. Sarah also killed it and sold a ton of other items on the shop. 🤙</span>

<h3 class="margin-top-30">✅ 2. Daily meditation for at least 5 minutes</h3>

<span class="sub-bullet">☞ **Note:** While I did miss a day here and there, I practiced meditation almost daily and usually for 10 minutes.</span>

<h3 class="margin-top-30">✅ 3. Read 8 books</h3>

<span class="sub-bullet">☞ **Note:** I probably only read 5 or 6 from cover to cover, but read and gained valuable knowledge from at least 8 books and other sources as well. Here's my <a href="/reading-list-2017">reading list</a> from 2017 if you're interested.</span>

<h3 class="margin-top-30">⛔️ 4. 30 minute prep on Sunday afternoon or evenings to prepare for the week ahead</h3>

<span class="sub-bullet">☞ **Note:** I did this for a couple weeks, but didn't find any real benefit from doing it so decided to stop.</span>

<h3 class="margin-top-30">✅ &amp; ⛔️ 5. Exercise</h3>

<span class="sub-bullet"> — Complete **Insanity** 4 times</span>

<span class="sub-bullet"> — Run or some other light workout in-between Insanity sessions</span>

<span class="sub-bullet"> — Start doing yoga with Sarah a couple days a week</span>

<span class="sub-bullet">☞ **Note:** After completing Insanity once, we decided to try other exercises rather than doing it another three times. We switched between a few different things, such as daily 7 minute workouts, yoga, basketball, and started running 4 - 5 days a week.</span>

<h2 class="margin-top-30">2018 Goals:</h2>

I'm thinking of doing something a little different this year. I'm going to break my goals up into quarterly themes with mini-goals within each theme. Here we go...

<h3>Q1: "Move"</h3>

<span class="sub-bullet"> — Move to a new city</span>

<span class="sub-bullet"> — Continue running and complete a 10k run before end of quarter (EOQ)</span>

<span class="sub-bullet"> — Practice yoga at least once a week</span>


<h3 class="margin-top-30">Q2: "Disconnect"</h3>

<span class="sub-bullet"> — Deactivate my Facebook account indefinitely</span>

<span class="sub-bullet"> — Go on a Twitter and Instagram hiatus until EOQ</span>

<span class="sub-bullet"> — Use the time I'd normally be on social media to read or write instead</span>


<h3 class="margin-top-30">Q3: "Grow"</h3>

<span class="sub-bullet"> — Complete one or two Udemy courses</span>

<span class="sub-bullet"> — Build a new project (app or site just for fun)</span>

<span class="sub-bullet"> — Read every day</span>


<h3 class="margin-top-30">Q4: "Give"</h3>

<span class="sub-bullet"> — Research and donate to at least two charities that are making a difference</span>

<span class="sub-bullet"> — Spread awareness of quality charities for others interested in donating</span>

<span class="sub-bullet"> — Volunteer for at least a few hours</span>
