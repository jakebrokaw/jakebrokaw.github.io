title: A Short Story On How GitLab & Jake Saved The World
---

## Chapter I: The Beginning

It all began on a cold, rainy evening in February. The world appeared to be getting darker and darker by the day as it seemed destined to be ruled by people who only cared about themselves and their Tide Pods. But the Universe had a different storyline in mind--one that involved pairing a mild-mannered web developer with an organization [focused on helping others](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/#collaboration).

Before we dive into the epic tale of how these characters combined their powers to save the world, letâ€™s first learn a little more about this mild-mannered web developer's backstory and see why the Universe felt he should join forces with GitLab.

## Chapter II: The Backstory

Jake Brokaw has spent the last three years working remotely as a Marketing Web Designer and Developer for a software company, called [Formstack](https://formstack.com). Prior to that he worked as an Applications Developer for Nationwide Insurance for two years. He loves the remote life and has lived in 3 different cities in the past four years. He and his wife (and their large cats) are actually in the process of moving again, [this time to Portland](/moving-to-the-northwest). He assumed his life was chaotic enough for the time being, but...

_**PLOT TWIST!**_ ðŸ’¨

One day, while surfing the interwebz, he was bitten by a radioactive [tanuki](https://about.gitlab.com/about/#logo)! Soon after the bite, he noticed things were...well, different. Life started to make sense again. The air was fresher, food tasted better, the sky was filled with angels singing "Don't Stop Me Now," <a href="https://www.good.is/articles/happiest-song-on-earth" target="_blank" md_>the happiest song on Earth</a>.

For the first time, he was able to see his experiences as actual super powers he could use to save the world. It didn't matter that he had years of experience writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to create <a href="/work" target="_blank" md_>responsive websites and landing pages</a>. What mattered was that he would now able to use those powers to give GitLab customers (and potential customers) a smooth user experience.

It didn't matter that he worked with website strategists to brainstorm, develop, and implement effective A/B tests. What mattered was that he could use that knowledge to create meaningful designs based off of real data to ensure GitLab's value was truly understood.

It didn't matter that he loved working in Sketch to design new pages and graphics every day. What mattered was that he could use the tools he cherished to visually represent the good that GitLab brings into the world.

It didn't matter that he helped create a design system from scratch. It didn't even matter that he <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BaG8lvUlkcj/?taken-by=jacobrokaw" target="_blank" md_>gave talks about design systems</a> to the Tulsa UX Group and the web design students at the University of Tulsa. What mattered was that he could now use his organization and communication skills to clearly explain the wonders of GitLab to the masses.

Now, thanks to that radioactive tanuki bite, he was finally able to see what the Universe had been mapping out for years.

## Chapter III: The Mission

Once the Universe made it blatantly clear that Jake and GitLab should join forces, they both decided they couldn't delay the inevitable any longer. They teamed up so that Jake could help GitLab on their quest to change all creative work from read-only to read-write <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/strategy/#mission" target="_blank" md_>so that everyone can contribute</a>.

Jake whole-heartily agreed with GitLab's belief that all digital products should be open to contributions. With this goal in mind, they worked together to ensure that more people were aware of this powerful software and the opportunities it gave their organizations. They did this through interactive landing pages, beautiful emails, enticing graphics, and informative resources.
