  I’m a web developer &amp; designer living in Portland, Oregon with my favorite <a href="https://www.sparks-of-art.com">human</a> and my two favorite <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/wm-FsonqsK/?taken-by=jacobrokaw">non-humans</a>. I’ve been in the web development world for the last 6 years and have worked in all kinds of settings—from large corporations to software start-ups, universities to nonprofits and small mom & pop shops.

   After meeting in California, my wife and I have lived in four different states in the past five years. I’ve enjoyed the experience of living in a city for a year or so before going to explore somewhere new. However, I think we’ve finally found a “home” here in Portland. My favorite nights consist of drinking a hot cup of tea and reading a good book (#introvertproblems). My greatest weakness is rooting for the <a href="/did-the-browns-win">Cleveland Browns</a>.
