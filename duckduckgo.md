title: A Story On How DuckDuckGo & Jake Saved The World
---

## Chapter I: The Beginning

The world was becoming a very dark and strange place: kids were eating Tide Pods; tech giants were manipulating users and selling their information for their own profit; someone was selling a "high-tech" juicer for $400; etc. Luckily, the universe had a plan to bring positive change and stability back into the worldâ€”a plan that involved pairing a mild-mannered designer with an organization focused on empowering people <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/about" target="_blank" md_>to take control of their information.</a>.

Before we dive in to the epic tale of how these characters combined their powers to save the world, letâ€™s learn a little more about our mild-mannered front-end developer, Jake, and see why the universe felt he was the right person to join forces with DuckDuckGo.

## Chapter II: The Backstory

Jake Brokaw has spent the last four years working remotely as a Designer and Developer for <a href="https://formstack.com" target="_blank" md_>Formstack</a>. He and his team oversee and develop websites and branding materials for two recently acquired SaaS companies as well. He has also spent time as an IT Applications Developer for <a href="https://www.nationwide.com/" target="_blank" md_>Nationwide Insurance</a>, working as a freelance designer, and even running a small Etsy shop with his wife. He has taken advantage of the remote life, living in four different cities in the past five years. He and his wife (and their crazy cats) recently <a href="/moving-to-the-northwest" target="_blank" md_>moved up to Portland, Oregon</a>. He thought his life was chaotic enough for the time being, but then...

_**PLOT TWIST!**_ ðŸ’¨

One day, while surfing the interwebs, the universe planted an idea into Jake's mind. The idea was as simple as it was profound: He should combine his skillset with his passion for privacy.

After this realization, the only question left to answer was: Who might Jake pair up with to accomplish this quest? Fortunately, the perfect role opened up with a company setting the new standard of trust onlineâ€”**DuckDuckGo**. From that moment on, Jake's whole world was...different. Life started to make sense again. The air was fresher, food tasted better, the sky was filled with ducks singing "Don't Stop Me Now," <a href="https://www.good.is/articles/happiest-song-on-earth" target="_blank" md_>the happiest song on Earth</a> (listening to this song while finishing the rest of the story is encouraged ðŸ˜‰).

## Chapter III: The Match

Once the universe made it blatantly clear that Jake and DuckDuckGo should join forces, they both decided they couldn't delay the inevitable any longer.

Jake had used his love of simiple and scalable design to <a href="/work" target="_blank" md_>create intentional and informative sites and landing pages</a> in the past, but now he was able to do it knowing those skills would help provide people with the online privacy they deserve. Jake's knowledge and experience with creating, implementing, and maintaining <a href="https://formstack.com/brand/" target="_blank" md_>Formstack's Brand Design System</a> allowed him to implement thoughtful and well crafted components across DuckDuckGo's products. (Fun fact: Jake was even invited to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BaG8lvUlkcj/?taken-by=jacobrokaw" target="_blank" md_>speak to the Tulsa UX group</a> about his experience with design systems.) Lastly, since he is a developer as well, he understands how a collaborative design and development process will always benefit a company and it's users.

## Chapter IV: The World is Saved

Because of the work that DuckDuckGo and Jake were able to accomplish together, the world was a safer and brighter place to live. Tide Pods went back to being used solely for laundry purposes. The internet became a more private and secure place for all to enjoy safely. The $400 juicer startup, Juicero, was thankfully shut down. All was well with the world.

The universe knew what it was doing when it paired Jake with DuckDuckGo, a company that was already contributing so much good to the world. They, along with everyone else in the world, lived happily ever after.
